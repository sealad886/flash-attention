Yeah, definitely. I think I have a feeling that it's just because it's the weekend.
Yeah, so look, I'll keep an eye on it. I checked it there today again and still can.
So I'll let you know by tomorrow.
Hopefully it's up and running by then.
But as soon as I send it over, I'll let you know.
So I'll be sure you get the notification anyway.
All right. OK, apologies for this. Sorry about it.
We'll get it sorted.
